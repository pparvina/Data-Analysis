# Data-Analysis


## Introduction

For the Udacity Nanodegree Programm, I was given a final project to conduct  data analysis and create a file that documents my findings. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used pandas and NumPy Python libraries to answer the research questions that I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 

Specifically, I have focused my project around these questions:
- What is the relationship of popularity of the movie and its budget? Do popular movies have higher budgets?
- Are older movies more popular than newer ones or vice versa? What year has released the most popular movie?
- Do popular movies have recieved highest revenue? What movie have rieceived highest revenue?

## To be able to replicate this project please follow the inructions below: 

Step One - Choose Your Data Set

Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually youâ€™ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:

## The report communicating your findings

Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)
You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook, in which case you can submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to submit your report and code separately. If you would like a notebook template to help organize your investigation, you can click here. Or there may be a page in the project here called Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project, where you can do all your work and submit the project.

## Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options to help you get started.

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

## Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.

## Findings 

This project was based on movie ratings, and analyzed what movies were the most popular and its relation to its revenue and budget. 

## Results 
This project provided data analysis on movie ratings, and have underlined the key findings, and it's relevance on the data.
