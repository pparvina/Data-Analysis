#Exploring_weather_trends#

This project is done for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program where I analysed the local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in Los Angeles where I am currently based at, and global temperature trends. 

#Getting Started#
To run the same analyses you would need: 
-SQL
-MS Excel
